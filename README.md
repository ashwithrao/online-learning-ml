# Online Learning Machine Learning Project

This project shows how a machine learning model can learn from data one row at a time.

## What this project does
- Uses Logistic Regression
- Learns from streaming CSV data
- Updates model after every data row
- Shows real-time accuracy using sliding window

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## How to use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Watch predictions update live

## Why this project
Online learning is useful when data arrives continuously and models must adapt in real time.
